embedded-midifile-library-prototype
===================================

A prototype of a midi file parser for the stm32vldiscovery board. This is based on an awsome midi library based on c. It consumes too much memory for an embedded system so this library has to be optimised for that usecase.  The repository includes visual studio 2010 project files.
